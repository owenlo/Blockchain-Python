# Blockchain-Python
Example blockchain implemented in Python. 

The SHA-256 hashing algorithm is used. The difficulty of the mining operation is defined as the number of leading 0s when a block is hashed. A difficulty of 5 (default in code) means that the first 5 hexadecimal values of the hash for a given solution must be 0.

Run main.py for demo. See code for additional information.
